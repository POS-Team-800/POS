POSCoin - The Proof of Signature Blockchain Platform


POSCoin is a newly invented blockchain infrastructure that does not require any traditional type of mining support, such as: POW or POS. We have created something called Proof of Signature which ensures that 100% of all blocks will be signed by the system when they occur. The blocks are signed by the network of Master Nodes after verifying the transactions in the block.

# Our mission

We aim to deliver a blockchain platform that provides users with superior speed, security, and scalability over present blockchain offerings. In order to do so, we have crafted a unique Proof of Signature consensus algorithm that obtains these benefits in an economical and eco-friendly manner. Moreover, our platformâ€™s modular nature allows users to assume an infinite capacity for growth. And with modularity driving our development pipeline, we have instituted enhanced usability for programmers and end-users alike. This includes code-agnostic APIs, superior technical support, and best-in-class user interfaces. All to achieve our vision of having users and developers view POSCoin as the premier blockchain platform within the cryptocurrency world.
